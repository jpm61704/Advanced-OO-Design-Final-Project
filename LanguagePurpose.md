# Why was the language created?

## C# (sharp)

* This was Microsoft's language to compete in the OO market.

* Microsoft wanted to have a language that would compete with java.

  * Microsoft tried to extend Java with a language called j++ but sun (now Oracle) sued Microsoft for violating Java's terms and license agreement.


* Microsoft's original attempt was C++ however with complexities such as Memory management, issues with Multithreading applications, and complex multi-inheritance rules, C++ was not a good permanent solution.


## Ruby

* The creator of Ruby said, "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language."

* The Ruby creator wanted to create a language that would be truly OO.

* The creator of Ruby wanted a language that was fit for him.

  * Syntactically Simple, Exception handling, Garbage collection, and portable.


# What problems was the language trying to address?

## C# (sharp)

* The language was intended for writing applications for both hosted and embedded systems.

* The language was also intended to be a simple modern OO language.

* C# was not intended to compete with C based on performance and size


## Ruby

* The creator wanted a genuine OO language with easy scripting.

# Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

## C# (sharp)

* Yes as mentioned above Microsoft's original attempt was C++ and C# was a better solution.

## Ruby

* Yes because the creator didn't like some of the languages he was using and then decided to make his own language for his own solution.
