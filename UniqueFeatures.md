## Unique Features of the Languages

## C# (Sharp)

* C# runs in the <u>Common Language Runtime</u>, which was designed from the beginning to support <u>interoperability</u> between languages.

  * Common Language Runtime: runs the code and provides services that make the development process easier.

  * interoperability: the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information.

* A unique feature to C# apart from other Microsoft developed languages is no pointers

* There is absolutely no direct memory manipulation

* Uses the .NET framework

* Integer Values of 0 and 1 are no longer accepted as boolean


## Ruby

* Everything, and we mean everything is an object. Even simple numerical values.

* Ruby allows for entire blocks of code to be passed as parameters to to functions

  * Comparable to function pointers in C

* Values of the LAST expression in a method automatically become the return value

*  Uniquely terrible is that you cannot use the ++ and -- operations...

* Only nil and false evaluate to false in conditional statements:

  * if(0) --> will be deemed true and run the given block of code
